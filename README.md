# 2D-Chebyshev-Spectral-Collocation
Project code from APPM 4660 Numerical Analysis course to solve 2D Heat equation and Helmholtz equation with Chebyshev spectral collocation. Project report in APPM_4660_Spectral_Methods_Project_Final.pdf

Driver code in Project_main.m

Functions:

HeatEq1D - solves the 1D heat equation with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions. Uses either implicit euler time-stepping or RK4

HeatEq2D - solves 2D heat equation with non-constant thermal conductivity on a structured grid. Uses Forward Euler time stepping.


SpectralCollocation_BVP - solves 2D Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet, Robin, and Neumann BCs.
